## Project 3: Where Am I

Application of using the adaptive monte carlo localizatin (AMCL) algorithm is implemented in ROS. AMCL dynamically adjusts the number of particles over a period of time, as the robot navigates around in a map. The process of AMCL algorithm is followed by the [amcl](http://wiki.ros.org/amcl) ROS package to get a working localization.
